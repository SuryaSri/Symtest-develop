- Language Used : Java

- Unit Tests : JUnit

Development code. Adding function call code to symtest code.

SymTest is a test generation tool using symbolic testing and graph algorithms to generate efficient test sequences for embedded software systems.

The current Sysmtest framework generates tests sequences using graph algorithms, to this we add the functionality to symbollically execute function calls. The sysmtest framework now executes functions symbolically and efficiently when the graph alogrithms visit a function call statement.
